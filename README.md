# WME SDK TypeScript Example

This project helps you **bootstrap a TypeScript-based WME script** using the WME SDK.

It provides a clean project setup with build scripts, type checking, and release automation ‚Äî so you can focus on writing your script!

---

## Setup options

You can use this project in two ways:

- üü° **Option 1: using DevContainers (recommended)** ‚Äî no need to install anything globally
- üü° **Option 2: manual local setup** ‚Äî install Node.js and Rollup yourself

**Important:** You **MUST** enable "Allow access to file URLs" for Tampermonkey, as explained [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q204). Without this, Tampermonkey cannot load your local files during development.

---

## Option 1: Using DevContainers (recommended)

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [DevContainers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Open this folder in VS Code
2. When prompted, **reopen in Dev Container** (or run: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`)
3. The container will automatically install all dependencies (`npm install`)
4. You can now run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

No need to install Node.js, npm or Rollup globally ‚Äî everything is handled inside the container.

---

## Option 2: Manual local setup

If you prefer to run the project directly on your machine:

### Required once

* Install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* Allow local file access for the Tampermonkey extension, as explained [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q204)
* Install [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) globally:

```bash
npm install --global rollup
```

(This tool bundles your script for use in Tampermonkey.)

* (Optional) Install Git to manage file versions

---

## Getting started

1. Download this repository (as a zip) or clone it via git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bedo2991/wme-typescript.git
```

2. Initialize your own git repo if needed:

```bash
git init
```

3. Update the details in:

* `header.js` and `header-dev.js` ‚Üí update author, script name, etc.
* `main.user.ts` ‚Üí set your script ID and name

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Coding

* Open the project in an IDE (e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
* You will get type checking and autocomplete thanks to the WME SDK typings.
* The `.ts` file containing your script (`main.user.ts`) needs to be translated to javascript in order to be used by Tampermonkey.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: the content of the .out folder is generated, you should never edit anything in here.
* During development, run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

This will continuously compile `.ts` to `.js`.

When ready to release:

```bash
npm run release
```

---

## Prepare for a release

1. Update the version number in `package.json`
2. Run:

```bash
npm run release
```

A file will be created in the `releases/` folder with the version in its name.

---

## Scripts explained

You can see all available scripts in `package.json`:

* `compile`: compiles your script once ‚Äî usually not needed manually
* `watch`: continuously compiles when code changes ‚Äî use this when developing
* `concat`: combines your `header.js` with compiled `.out/main.user.js`
* `build`: compile + concat
* `release`: updates version in `header.js` and builds release file

---

## Switching between production and beta typings

1. Uninstall current typings:

```bash
npm uninstall wme-sdk-typings
```

2. Install desired version:

**Production:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev https://web-assets.waze.com/wme_sdk_docs/production/latest/wme-sdk-typings.tgz
```

**Beta:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev https://web-assets.waze.com/wme_sdk_docs/beta/latest/wme-sdk-typings.tgz
```
